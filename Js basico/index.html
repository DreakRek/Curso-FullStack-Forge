                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>
                    lightweight language maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                    environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
                    ‘them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Variable Declaration JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                    a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;
                    </p>
                    <p>Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
                    variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;
                    </p>
                    <p>Data Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
                    that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!";
                    Amray - [1, ‘Coding’, 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: ‘Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}
                    </p>
                    <p>Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
                    values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                    conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                    condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
                    </p>
                    <p>Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                    an action some number of times. Imagine you have to Tun a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                    </p>
                    <p>Function Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
                    instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
                    tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
